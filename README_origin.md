> Details of run\_analysis.R script and what will it do

-   This is the script used to perform analysis on raw data and create a
    tidy datafile called tidydata.txt

    -   Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
    -   Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard
        deviation for each measurement.  
    -   Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the
        data set.  
    -   Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable
        names.  
    -   From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy
        data set with the average of each variable for each activity and
        each subject.
